# Unichain node operation guide/repo

This repo is a guide for operating a Unichain node, based on my personal experience. You probably need to be at least an intermediate blockchain enthusiast to follow this guide, with some experience working in a command-line, Linux, and blockchain environment. You will probably run into at least some issues.
